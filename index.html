    <p><h1><b>Chapter 1 - Black Mesa Inbound - A normal day?</b></h1><br>Our tale lies on a theoretical physicist, Gordon Freeman. Today is one Gordon will never forget.<br>
It starts like a normal day like any other, Gordon gets onto the tram late, the time is 8:47 am, topside temperature is at 93 degrees while the Black Mesa Facility is maintained at 68 degrees. During the tram ride, he gets a view on the facility. After the tram ride, the security guard near the door walks over to the tram door to unlock the door. <br><br>
“Morning Mr. Freeman, looks like you're running late.” reminds the guard. Freeman steps out and follows with the guard to the airlock door. The guard enters a code on a keypad close to the door and the airlock door opens. Freeman steps in and the airlock door begins to close.<br><br>
<h1><b>Chapter 2 - Anomalous Materials - The experiment.</b></h1><br>
The second door opens and Freeman goes through, entering the lobby. The guard at the desk tells Freeman "Hey Mr. Freeman, I had a bunch of messages for you but we had a system crash about 20 minutes ago and I'm still trying to find my files. Just one of those days I guess. They were having some problems down in the test chamber too, but I think that's all straightened out." The desk guard’s computer appears to still be on a blue screen. Freeman acknowledges the message and proceeds to the locker room. On the way he goes to a break room and spots a microwave with a casserole. Freeman, being the man he is, heats up the microwave and blows up the casserole. Freeman went back out and went to the locker room.</p>
